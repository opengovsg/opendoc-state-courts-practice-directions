# Part XI: Judgements and Orders

## 74. Draft orders of Court

(1) **Draft orders for *inter partes* applications**

> (a) Order 42, Rules 8(1) and (2) of the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5) places the burden of approving the drafts of inter partes judgments and orders on the solicitors themselves. The solicitors should therefore approve the drafts and not submit these drafts to the Registrar for approval.

> (b) The Registrar's signature on a judgment or order is only for the purpose of validity and does not in any way affect the regularity or irregularity of the contents of any judgment or order.

> (c) Subject to sub-paragraph (d), parties in *inter partes* applications should proceed to engross a final copy of the draft judgment for signature by the Registrar *after* agreeing on the draft. Draft orders of Court for *ex parte* applications (except probate matters) may be submitted with the summons and the supporting affidavit when these are filed.

> (d) For draft orders in electronic form that are composed online through the Electronic Filing Service, the process for extracting judgments and orders shall be as follows:

>> (i) Parties have the option of filing a system-generated order of court through the Electronic Filing Service.

>> (ii) Before filing the system-generated order of court, the party extracting the order must review and edit the order of court electronic form to ensure that it accurately reflects the orders made by the Court and obtain the approval of all other parties to the application and provide evidence of such approval when filing the draft order of court, for example, a Portable Document Format (PDF) copy of a draft order of court signed by the solicitors of all parties to the application.

> (e) Where parties disagree over one or more terms of the order of court, the party filing the draft order of court shall be responsible for including in the order of court electronic form all versions of the disputed terms by editing the order of court electronic form. All relevant correspondence concerning the dispute must be provided when filing the draft order of court.

> (f) The Registry will seal and issue an engrossed order of court once its terms are approved.
>
> (g) Order 42, Rules 8(3) to (5) of the Rules of Court shall continue to apply.

## 75. Unnecessary extraction of orders of Court

(1) Certain orders are extracted by parties when such orders need not be drawn up under the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5). The attention of solicitors is drawn to Order 42, Rule 9, of the Rules of Court in this regard.

(2) To reduce unnecessary documentation and to expedite proceedings, solicitors are requested not to extract orders that need not be drawn up.

## 76. Judgment in default of appearance or service of defence

(1) The previous practice of applying for search for appearance and obtaining a certificate of non-appearance before judgment in default of appearance is entered is discontinued.

(2) In writ of summons proceedings where the writ is electronically filed, the procedure for applying for judgment in default of appearance or service of defence will be by way of filing a Request to enter judgment in Form 79A, together with the judgment in Form 79, in Appendix A to the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5). Solicitors’ attention is drawn to Order 13, Rule 7(1) and Order 19, Rule 8A of the Rules of Court.

(3) For Requests to enter judgment electronic forms composed online through the Electronic Filing Service, a signed hard copy of the Request to enter judgment electronic form shall be retained by the solicitor concerned and produced to the Court when required by the Court to do so.

(4) In order to satisfy itself that a defendant is in default of appearance or service of defence, the Court may require an affidavit to be filed stating the time and manner service of the Writ of Summons was effected on the defendant, as well as the steps taken to ascertain that the defendant had failed to enter an appearance or serve a defence, as the case may be.

(5) For the avoidance of doubt, Requests for entry of default judgment shall be filed as a Portable Document Format (PDF) document for suits where the memorandum of service has been filed before 30 September 2013. For all other cases, the Request for entry of default judgment electronic form shall be composed online through the Electronic Filing Service.

## 77. Consent judgments or orders involving disposition or transfer of property

(1) In any request or application for a consent judgment or order involving any disposition or transfer of property, the parties must provide the following information to the Court:

> (a) the identity of the owner of the property subject to disposition or transfer;

> (b) whether the owner of the property is incapacitated by reason of insolvency from effecting a disposition or transfer of the property;

> (c) whether the property is subject to any encumbrance which would affect a disposition or transfer thereof; and

> (d) any other relevant information which ought to be considered by the Court in granting the consent judgment or order.

(2) The Court may require the information referred to in paragraph (1) to be provided by way of an affidavit, which should exhibit the relevant searches where applicable.
