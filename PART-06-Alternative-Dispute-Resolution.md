# Part VI: Alternative Dispute Resolution

## 35. Overview of Court Dispute Resolution (CDR) for civil cases

(1)  This Part of the Practice Directions focuses on CDR for civil disputes only.

(2)  Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) should be considered at the earliest possible stage. Court-driven ADR services give the parties the opportunity to resolve their disputes faster and more economically compared to determination at trial. These services are collectively termed “Court Dispute Resolution” (CDR) and, subject to the exception stated in paragraph (7), are provided by the Court for free. CDR sessions are convened under Order 34A of the Rules of Court (Cap. 322 R 5), which empowers the Court to convene pre-trial conferences for the purpose of the “just, expeditious and economical disposal of the cause or matter”.

(3)  In addition to CDR sessions provided by the Courts, the Courts also encourage parties to consider using other ADR procedures, including the following:

> (a)  Mediation at the Singapore Mediation Centre or Singapore International Mediation Centre;

> (b)  Mediation under the Law Society Mediation Scheme and/or Arbitration under the Law Society Arbitration Scheme; and

> (c)  Mediation and/or Arbitration by private service providers.

### Processes used for Court Dispute Resolution sessions

(4)  CDR is provided by the State Courts Centre for Dispute Resolution. There are 3 processes used —

> (a)  Mediation;

> (b)  Conciliation; and

> (c)  Neutral Evaluation.

> (Solicitors may refer to the State Courts’ website at [*http://www.statecourts.gov.sg*](http://www.statecourts.gov.sg/) for more information on these processes.)

(5)  Pursuant to Order 34A Rule 7 of the Rules of Court, no communication made in the course of a CDR session shall be disclosed to the Court conducting the trial of the action or proceedings if such communication has been stated by any of the parties to be confidential or without prejudice, or has been marked by the Judge at the CDR session as being confidential or without prejudice.

(6)  If the parties are unable to resolve their dispute at the CDR session, the Judge will give the necessary directions for the action to proceed to trial. The action will be tried by another Judge other than the Judge conducting the CDR session.

(7)  CDR sessions are provided by the State Courts Centre for Dispute Resolution without any fee, with the following exception set out in Order 90A Rule 5A of the Rules of Court (Cap. 322 R 5):

> *“(1) Subject to this Rule, a fee of $250 is payable by each party in a case in a District Court (regardless of whether the case is commenced before, on or after 1 May 2015) for all Court ADR services that are provided in the case.*
>
> *(2) The Court ADR fee is payable when the first Court ADR service to be provided in the case, pursuant to either of the following, is fixed:*

>> (a)  *a request made on or after 1 May 2015 for the Court ADR service by any party in the case;*

>> (b)  *a referral on or after 1 May 2015 by the Court or the Registrar.*

> *(3) No Court ADR fee is payable in any of the following actions:*

>> (a)  *any non-injury motor accident action (as defined in Order 59 Appendix 2 Part V);*

>> (b)  *any action for damages for death or personal injuries;*

>> (c)  *any action under the Protection from Harassment Act 2014 (Act 17 of 2014).*

> *(4) The Registrar may, in any case, waive or defer the payment of the whole or any part of the Court ADR fee on such terms and conditions as the Registrar deems fit.”*

(8)  Each party who has requested for CDR or has been referred for CDR pursuant to Order 90A Rule 5A shall pay the fee of $250 before proceeding for the scheduled CDR session. Details concerning the payment of these fees are provided in the relevant correspondence by the State Courts to the parties.

### Presumption of ADR for all cases

(9)  A “presumption of Alternative Dispute Resolution” applies to all civil cases. For this purpose, the Court —

> (a) encourages parties to consider ADR options as a “first stop”, at the earliest possible stage; and
>
> (b) will, as a matter of course, refer appropriate matters to CDR or other forms of ADR.

### Presumption of CDR for non-injury motor accident (NIMA) claims, personal injury claims and medical negligence claims

(10)  The following cases will be fixed for CDR:

> (a)  all non-injury motor accident (NIMA), personal injury cases and actions arising out of an alleged negligent act or omission in the course of medical or dental treatment (“medical negligence claims”) that are filed in the Magistrate's Court and the District Court; and

> (b)  all motor accident cases (whether or not involving any claim for personal injuries) and actions for personal injuries arising out of an industrial accident that are commenced in the High Court on or after 1st December 2016 and transferred to the District Court (references to NIMA and personal injury cases would hereinafter include these cases).

(11) The Court will send a notice to the solicitors fixing the date of the first CDR session within 8 weeks of the filing of the memorandum of appearance.

(12) The procedure and protocols set out in Practice Directions 37 (Non-injury Motor Accident (NIMA) Claims) and 38 (Personal Injury Claims) shall apply, as appropriate, to NIMA and personal injury claims, respectively.

(13) The procedure and protocols set out in Practice Direction 39 (Medical Negligence Claims) shall apply, as appropriate, to medical negligence claims.

### Presumption of ADR for other cases (excluding NIMA, personal injury and medical negligence cases):

#### A. Cases that are subject to the simplified process under Order 108 of the Rules of Court (Magistrate’s Court cases filed on or after 1st November 2014 and by consent, District Court cases filed on or after 1st November 2014)

(14) All cases commenced by writ on or after 1st November 2014 in a Magistrate’s Court and any case commenced by writ on or after 1st November 2014 in a District Court (where parties have filed their consent in Form 233 of Appendix A of the Rules of Court for Order 108 to apply) will be subject to the simplified process under Order 108 of the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5).

(15) The Court will convene a case management conference within 50 days of the filing of the Defence pursuant to Order 108 Rule 3 of the Rules of Court. At the case management conference, the Court may refer cases for CDR or other forms of ADR, where —

>
> *(b) the Court is of the view that doing so would facilitate the resolution of the dispute between the parties.”*

(16) Practice Direction 20 (Case management conference \[CMC\]) sets out details of the case management conference.

#### B. Cases that are not subject to the simplified process

(17) In all other cases commenced in a Magistrate’s Court before 1st November 2014, and all cases commenced in a District Court on or after 1st April 2014, the Court will fix a Pre-Trial Conference (PTC) within 4 months after the filing of the writ if —

> (a)  the Defence has been filed;

> (b)  no summons for directions or application for summary judgment, striking out, stay, transfer or consolidation of proceedings has been taken out for the case; and

> (c)  no CDR session has been fixed.

(18) Such cases shall be automatically referred by the Court for CDR or other forms of ADR during the PTC, unless the parties opt out of CDR/ADR.

(19) The procedure for referral to these CDR/ADR options is set out in Practice Direction 36 (Mode of referral to CDR/ADR etc.).

(20) Parties are not required to file a Request for CDR in the following cases:

> (a) all NIMA, personal injury and medical negligence claims as the parties are automatically notified by the Court to attend CDR;
>
> (b) all cases commenced by writ on or after 1st November 2014 in a Magistrate’s Court which are subject to the simplified process in Order 108 (excluding NIMA, personal injury and medical negligence claims) as the Court will deal with matters concerning CDR/ADR at the case management conference. Further details are set out in Part III of these Practice Directions; and
>
> (c) all cases commenced by writ before 1st November 2014 in a Magistrate’s Court, and all cases commenced in a District Court as the Court will refer the appropriate cases for CDR during PTCs or summonses for directions.

(21) A Request for CDR may be filed via the Electronic Filing Service when the parties wish to attempt CDR at an earlier stage.

### Request for Skype Mediation

(22) Parties can request for mediation to be conducted in the State Courts Centre for Dispute Resolution with one party appearing *via* Skype if the following requirements are satisfied:

(24) Both Part A and Part B of the Request for Skype Mediation have to be completed and endorsed by the relevant parties at the time of filing.

(25) Skype mediation proceedings or any part thereof shall not be recorded on video, audio or any other form. The attention of parties is also drawn to Order 38A Rule 4 of the Rules of Court.

### Request for adjournment of CDR session

(26) A dedicated time slot is set aside for each CDR session. In order to minimise wastage of time and resources, any request for adjournment of a CDR session shall be made early. A request to adjourn a CDR session —

> (a)  for NIMA and personal injury claims shall be made *not less than 2 working days* before the date of the CDR session; and

> (b)  for all other cases shall be made *not less than 7 working days* before the date of the CDR session.

(27) A request for an adjournment of a CDR session shall be made only by filing a “Request for Refixing/Vacation of Hearing Dates” *via* the Electronic Filing Service. The applicant shall obtain the consent of the other parties to the adjournment, and list the dates that are unsuitable for all parties.

### Sanctions for failure to make early request for adjournment, lateness or absence

(28) Where any party is absent without a valid reason for the CDR session, the Court may exercise its powers under Order 34A Rule 6 of the Rules of Court to “*dismiss such action or proceedings or strike out the defence or counterclaim or enter judgment or make such order as it thinks fit*”.

(29) Where any party is late for the CDR session, this conduct may be taken into account by the Court when making subsequent costs orders pursuant to Order 59 Rule 5(1)(c) of the Rules of Court, which states —

> *“The Court in exercising its discretion as to costs shall, to such extent, if any, as may be appropriate in the circumstances, take into account the parties' conduct in relation to any attempt at resolving the cause or matter by mediation or any other means of dispute resolution.”*

## 36. Mode of referral to CDR/ADR and consideration of CDR/ADR options: Case Management Conference, Pre-Trial Conference and Summons for Directions

(1) This Practice Direction applies to all civil cases except non-injury motor accident (NIMA) claims and personal injury claims.

### Case management conference for cases subject to the simplified process in Order 108 of the Rules of Court

(2) All cases commenced by writ *on or after 1st November 2014 in a Magistrate’s Court* and any case commenced by writ on or after 1st November 2014 in a District Court (where parties have filed their consent in Form 233 of Appendix A of the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5) for Order 108 to apply) are subject to the simplified process set out under Order 108 of the Rules of Court (Cap. 322, R 5). The Court will convene a case management conference within 50 days of the filing of the Defence pursuant to Order 108, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court. Practice Direction 20 (Case management conference \[CMC\]) sets out the procedure for the case management conference.

(3) At the case management conference, the Court *may refer cases for the most appropriate mode of ADR, where* —

> (a)  *the parties consent to the case being referred for resolution by the ADR process; or*

> (b)  *where the Court is of the view that doing so would facilitate the resolution of the dispute between the parties.*

(4) To facilitate the Court’s decision concerning CDR/ADR options, *all the parties and their solicitors must read and complete the CDR/ADR Form (Form 7 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions) prior to the case management conference.* The CDR/ADR Form must be filed through the Electronic Filing Service not less than 7 working days before the Case Management Conference under the document name “CDR/ADR Form”. No court fees will be charged for the filing of the CDR/ADR Form.

### Pre-trial conference and summons for directions for cases not subject to the simplified process

(5) Paragraphs (6) to (12) below do not apply to non-injury motor accident, personal injury and medical negligence claims. They apply to all cases, not subject to the simplified process in Order 108, that are

> (a) commenced before 1st November 2014 in a Magistrate’s Court; or
>
> (b) commenced in a District Court on or after 1st April 2014.

(6) To encourage the use of Court Dispute Resolution (CDR)/Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) at an early stage, the Court will convene a Pre-Trial Conference (PTC) *within 4 months after the writ is filed* for every case where —

> (a) the Defence has been filed;
>
> (b) no Summons for Directions (SFD) or application for summary judgment, striking out, stay, transfer or consolidation of proceedings has been taken out for the case; and
>
> (c) no CDR session has been fixed,

except that the parties will not be asked to attend a PTC in the event that they have earlier filed an SFD application.

(7) Parties may file an SFD application prior to the PTC and file a request to vacate the PTC. Practice Direction 26 (Summonses for Directions) applies accordingly.

(8) The solicitors for all the parties shall be present at the PTC. The parties need not attend the PTC.

(9) The Judge hearing the PTC will give the necessary directions to facilitate the management of the case. The Judge may also recommend the appropriate mode of CDR/ADR. To facilitate a considered decision on the CDR/ADR options, *the parties and their solicitors must read and complete the CDR/ADR Form (Form 7 in Appendix A to these Practice Directions) prior to the PTC.* A party who is not represented shall also complete the relevant sections of the CDR/ADR Form.

(10) The parties must file the CDR/ADR Form through the Electronic Filing Service not less than 7 working days before the PTC under the document name “CDR/ADR Form”. No court fees will be charged for the filing of the CDR/ADR Form.

(11) All cases shall be *automatically referred by the Court for the most appropriate mode of CDR/ADR during the PTC unless any or all of the parties opt out of CDR/ADR*. Any party who wishes to opt out should indicate his/her decision in the CDR/ADR Form.

(12) Where the Judge is of the view that CDR/ADR is suitable, and the party/parties have opted out of CDR/ADR for reasons deemed to be unsatisfactory, this conduct may be taken into account by the Court when making subsequent costs orders pursuant to Order 59 Rule 5(1)(c) of the Rules of Court, which states:

> “*The Court in exercising its discretion as to costs shall, to such extent, if any, as may be appropriate in the circumstances, take into account the parties' conduct in relation to any attempt at resolving the cause or matter by mediation or any other means of dispute resolution.*”

## 42. Neutral Evaluation

(1)  A brief form of Neutral Evaluation is used as a matter of practice in all motor accident and personal injury claims. The procedure for such CDR sessions is set out above in Practice Directions 37 (Non-injury Motor Accident (NIMA) Claims) and 38 (Personal Injury Claims), and Appendix B to these Practice Directions.

(2) The procedure in this Practice Direction applies only to civil cases other than  motor accident cases or personal injury cases where parties have requested for Neutral Evaluation.

### Procedure in Neutral Evaluation

(3) Information on the Neutral Evaluation process is set out at the State Courts’ website at <http://www.statecourts.gov.sg>. Neutral Evaluation involves the parties and their solicitors making presentations of their claims and defences, including the available evidence, followed by the Judge of the State Courts Centre for Dispute Resolution giving an assessment of the merits of the case. This process is also useful for helping parties to arrive at areas of agreement and to discuss methods of case management to save costs and time. The details of the structure and ambit of this process may be agreed between the parties at the preliminary conference referred to in paragraph (4).

### Preliminary conference with solicitors

(4) When parties request a Neutral Evaluation, the Court will convene a preliminary conference with the solicitors alone to discuss and agree on several options regarding the process before the date for Neutral Evaluation is fixed, i.e. —

> (a) whether the Neutral Evaluation is to be binding or non-binding;

> (b) whether the witnesses are to attend and be assessed by the court; and

> (c) whether affidavits of evidence-in-chief of witnesses are to be filed and used for the neutral evaluation, without witnesses’ attendance.

(5) If the option referred to in paragraph (4)(b) above is chosen, the Judge may use the “witness conferencing” approach to adduce expert evidence. Witness Conferencing involves the concurrent hearing of all expert witnesses in the presence of one another. Each party’s expert witness would be afforded the opportunity to question, clarify or probe any contending views proffered by the other expert.

### Opening Statements

(6) Each party must submit to the State Courts Centre for Dispute Resolution, and serve on all other parties, a written opening statement not less than 2 working days before the date of the Neutral Evaluation. The opening statement shall be submitted in hard copy and not filed via the Electronic Filing Service.  

(7) The opening statement shall be in the format prescribed in Form 9K in Appendix A to these Practice Directions. A soft copy of this Form may be downloaded at <http://www.statecourts.gov.sg>.

(8) The opening statement shall be concise and not exceed 10 pages.

### Attendance at Neutral Evaluation

(10) The solicitor who has primary conduct over the case shall be present throughout the Neutral Evaluation session.

(11) In the case of corporations and other entities, the representative who has authority to settle shall attend the Neutral Evaluation session.  In the event that only a board or body has authority to settle on behalf of the entity, the entity should send the person who is the most knowledgeable about the case and who is able to recommend a settlement to the representative’s board or body.
